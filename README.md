**TransWatch: A Robust Credit Card Fraud Detection System**


**Project Overview:**
The "Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions" project addresses the challenge of increasing fraudulent credit card activities faced by financial institutions. By implementing a robust fraud detection system using machine learning techniques, the aim is to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, thereby safeguarding financial assets.

**Approach:**
1. **Data Collection:** The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, containing credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values are handled, and the dataset is analyzed to understand the distribution of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical measures and visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset.
4. **Under-Sampling:** Due to the highly unbalanced nature of the dataset, under-sampling is performed to create a balanced sample dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
5. **Model Training:** Logistic Regression is chosen as the classification model due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
6. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on both training and test datasets using accuracy as the evaluation metric.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression
- Dataset: Kaggle (Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset)

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Analysis:** Basic data analysis is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values are handled, and the dataset is split into features and target variables.
4. **Under-Sampling:** A balanced sample dataset is created by under-sampling legitimate transactions.
5. **Model Training:** Logistic Regression model is trained using the balanced dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's accuracy is evaluated on both training and test datasets.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Financial Institutions: Banks and credit card companies can deploy this fraud detection system to automatically identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, reducing financial losses.
- E-commerce Platforms: Online retailers can use this system to detect fraudulent activities during online transactions, ensuring secure payment processing for customers.
- Insurance Companies: Insurance providers can implement fraud detection mechanisms to identify potentially fraudulent claims, minimizing fraudulent payouts.

**Note:**
- Ensure to install the required Python libraries mentioned in the project.
- Modify the input dataset path if necessary.
- Execute the code sequentially as per the provided instructions to replicate the project's results.
